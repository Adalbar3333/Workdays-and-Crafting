# Workdays-and-Crafting
## Crafting Rules
How to craft an item:

Find the item's price. Put the price in silver pieces (1gp = 10sp) and multiply it by 2. That is your goal. 
Find the DC for the item from the table below
Purchase, scavenge, or otherwise obtain the raw materials necessary. You generally need 1/2 the price of the item worth of materials to make the item. 
Make an Intelligence check for the day's work. If the check succeeds, multiply your check result by the DC. Using the correct tools allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the check.
If the result × the DC equals the price of the item in sp, then you have completed the item. (If the result × the DC equals double or triple the price of the item in silver pieces, then you’ve completed the task in one-half or one-third of the time. Other multiples of the DC reduce the time in the same manner.)
If the result × the DC doesn’t equal the price, then it represents the progress you’ve made today. Record the result and make a new Craft check tomorrow. Each day, you make more progress until your total reaches the price of the item in silver pieces.
If you FAIL a check by 4 or less, you make no progress this week. If you fail by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to purchase half the original raw material cost again.

Note: When crafting, you cannot use multiple of your own characters.

## Crafting a Magical Item

1: Identify the item you are trying to make. If the item is magical, you must identify the base item. 
     A. If you do not have the item, you must make the base item before you make the magical version.
     B. If you have the base item, you can start enchanting.

2: For every Workday you use, you roll a check associated with the item you are making. If you are making an normal item, the checks will be an artisans tool. If the check is to make a magical item, the check will be arcana (Unless you are making a potion or scroll. Then it will be a intelligence/charisma/wisdom Alchemist's Kit, or calligraphers kit.)

Your check when making a magical item will be based off your casting modifier. If you are not a caster, it is intelligence.

3: When you make a check, you can not have your roll be lower then the DC. If it is, the check fails. If the roll is 5 lower, you must pay 1/8 the price to fix the mistake, and continue your enchanting. 

4: When you make the skill or tool check and it is a success, you multiply the roll by the DC of the item, plus 1/2 your proficiency bonus. You add that number to your to SP goal.

5 Once you have all the detail figured out, you will put it into the from pinned in #crafting-approval and ping a DM. 

Note If you have a spell that can help you when enchanting, the SP goal is reduced by 25%
